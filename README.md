# Sport_NFO
This is a basic .nfo creator for Sports programming using SportsDB

Simply open NFO_Creator.py in terminal

This is meant to be a project to help me learn some python basics and how to implement and integrate them into a useful program.

A big thanks to theSportsDB.com as it is their API I'm using in this script.

Currently this program relies on user input however I am planning to make it cycle through filenames, parse those names and come up with an .nfo file automatically.
